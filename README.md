## About
A simple Thunderbird addon that adds a [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) button to the toolbar.

In contrast to the official paid [Proton Mail Bridge](https://proton.me/mail/bridge) client, this addon does not
add your Proton Mail account to Thunderbird. Instead, it opens the Proton Mail website as a new tab inside of Thunderbird.
If you want to use Thunderbird's mail features, you must use the paid official Proton Mail Bridge client.
